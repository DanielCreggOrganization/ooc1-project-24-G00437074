# OOC1 Project

**Title:** Song Manager
**Name:** Adam Devlin 
**Student ID:** G00437074

## Application Function

My Application, Song Manager, has a variety of things it does to ensure all 4 Pillars of OOP are used.

For Encapsulation, the code provides a basic framework for an interactive console-based application that display details of a Song Object, allowes the user to interact with a menuc and continunes to run until the user selects to quit.

For Inheritance, the code demonstrates how inheritance can be used, where the Genre class inherits methods from the parent class (Song) and add it's own functionality specific to the song's genre.

For Polymorphism, this code demonstrates basic concepts of OOP, including inheritance, compositon and method overriding. 

And for Abstration, the code here demonstrates abstraction, where the SongInfo abstract class defines common properties and behaviour for songs, while subclasses like PopSong and RockSong provide specific implementations for how to display song details.


## Running the Application

Provide step by step instructions on how to run your applicaiton. Are there any prerequisite softwares required?

```list
List the instructions step by step
    1. Create the project folder (e.g. Song Manager)
    2. Create your main class, Main.java.
    3. Write the Classes 
        - Song.java
        - Genre.java
        - MusicLibrary.java
        - SongWithDuration.java
        - SongWith ReleaseData.java
        - SongPlaylist.java
        - SongInfo.java
        - PopSong.java
        - RockSong.java
        - Note: Make sure all methods (e.g. play(), getInfo() etc.) are implemented in these classes.
    4. Compile your Java Code (if everything is set up correctly, it will generate all .class files in your project.)
    5. Run the Application
    6. Interact with the Application
        - Change inputs, add an artist, delete an artist etc.
    7. Debugging (if there are any errors, fix them based on error messages and try again)
    7. Closing the Program (To quit press 5)

```

## Minimum Project Requirements

Describe how you have met all minimum project requirements below:

* The repository contains, at minimum, two commits per week (Note: There should be many commits per day coding). DONE
* The project, including code and documentation, is fully contained in the provided GitHub Classroom repository. DONE
* Methods = Add Item, Remove Item, Update Item, Find total items, Search Items and Quit. DONE
* The code MUST compile. DONE
* The application code must be formatted in a consistent and standard way. DONE
* The code must contain comments. One comment per class, method and variable at minimum. DONE
* The documentation and commentary must be free of a grammar and speling mistakes. DONE

## Project Requirements above and beyond

Discuss any application features or design elements that show you went above and beyond basic requirements.

## Application Architecture

Discuss in detail how the application is structured. List all classes and describe their purpose. List all methods and describe what they do.

## Roadblocks and Unfinished Functionality

What did you not get finished? Discuss the issues you faced when creating your application Provide possible solutions to these issues. What would you have done differently if you had to do this project again?
